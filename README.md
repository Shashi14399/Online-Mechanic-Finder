# Online-Mechanic-Finder
This is a mechanic finding website in which the customers can request a mechanic at their location and aspiring mechanics can find a job. Based on the users' real time location we select the top three nearest mechanics and recommend the mechanic with the highest rating. The front-end uses different CSS and Bootstrap styling features to make the website more appealing and also integrates javascript to propagate this.The backend uses SQLite database to store appropriate information that the webpage requires, this data is accessed with the help of FLASK which excecutes them on the server side and thus integrating all the HTML functionality with that of CSS and JS to produce a website capable of implementing some of the features of a mechanic finding website on a smaller scale.
